Step 2 — Deploying a New Drupal 9 Site Using DDEV
With DDEV running, you will now use it to create a Drupal-specific filesystem, install Drupal 9, and then initiate a standard website project.

First, you will create a project root directory and then move inside it. You will run all remaining commands from this location. This tutorial will use d9test, but you are free to name your directory something else. Note, however, that DDEV doesn’t handle hyphenated names well. It is considered a best practice to avoid directory names like my-project or drupal-site-1.

Create your project root directory and navigate inside:

mkdir d9test
cd d9test
DDEV excels at creating directory trees that match specific CMS platforms. Use the ddev config command to create a directory structure specific to Drupal 9:

ddev config --project-type=drupal9 --docroot=web --create-docroot
You will see an output like this:

Output
Creating a new ddev project config in the current directory (/Users/sammy/d9test)
Once completed, your configuration will be written to /Users/sammy/d9test/.ddev/config.yaml

Created docroot at /Users/sammy/d9test/web
You have specified a project type of drupal9 but no project of that type is found in /Users/sammy/d9test/web
Ensuring write permissions for d9new
No settings.php file exists, creating one
Existing settings.php file includes settings.ddev.php
Configuration complete. You may now run 'ddev start'.
Because you passed --project-type=drupal9 to your ddev config command, DDEV created several subdirectories and files that represent the default organization for a Drupal website. Your project directory tree will now look like this:

A Drupal 9 directory tree
.
├── .ddev
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── config.yaml
│   ├── db-build
│   │   └── Dockerfile.example
│   └── web-build
│       └── Dockerfile.example
└── web
    └── sites
        └── default
            ├── .gitignore
            ├── settings.ddev.php
            └── settings.php

6 directories, 7 files
.ddev/ will be the main folder for the ddev configuration. web/ will be the docroot for your new project; it will contain several specific settings. files. You now have the initial scaffolding for your new Drupal project.

Your next step is to initialize your platform, which will build the necessary containers and networking configurations. DDEV binds to ports 80 and 443, so if you are running a web server like Apache on your machine, or anything else that uses those ports, stop those services before continuing.

Use the ddev start command to initialize your platform:

ddev start
This will build all the Docker-based containers for your project, which include a web container, a database container, and phpmyadmin. When the initialization completes you will see an output like this (your port number might differ):

...
[secondary_label Output]
Successfully started d9test
Project can be reached at http://d9test.ddev.site http://127.0.0.1:32773
Note: Remember that DDEV is starting Docker containers behind the scenes here. If you want to view those containers or verify that they are running, you can always use the docker ps command:

docker ps
Alongside any other containers that you are currently running, you will find four new containers, each running a different image: php-myadmin, ddev-webserver, ddev-router, and ddev-dbserver-mariadb.

ddev start has successfully built your containers and given you an output with two URLs. While this output says that your project “can be reached at http://d9test.ddev.site and http://127.0.0.1:32773,” visiting these URLs right now will throw an error. Starting with Drupal 8, the Drupal core and the contrib modules function like dependencies. Therefore, you’ll first need to finish installing Drupal using Composer, the package manager for PHP projects, before anything loads in your web browser.

One of the most useful and elegant features of DDEV is that you can pass Composer commands through the DDEV CLI and into your containerized environment. This means that you can separate your machine’s specific configuration from your development environment. You no longer have to manage the various file path, dependency, and version issues that generally accompany local PHP development. Moreover, you can quickly context-switch between multiple projects using different frameworks and tech stacks with minimal effort.

Use the ddev composer command to download drupal/recommended-project. This will download Drupal core, its libraries, and other related resources and then create a default project:

ddev composer create "drupal/recommended-project"
Now download one final component called Drush, or Drupal Shell. This tutorial will only use one drush command, and this tutorial provides an alternative, but drush is a powerful CLI for Drupal development that can improve your efficiency.

Use ddev composer to install drush:

ddev composer require "drush/drush"
You have now built a default Drupal 9 project and installed drush. Now you will view your project in a browser and configure your website’s settings.

Step 3 — Configuring Your Drupal 9 Project
Now that you have installed Drupal 9 you can visit your new project in your browser. To do this, you can rerun ddev start and copy one of the two URLs that it outputs, or you can use the following command, which will automatically launch your site in a new browser window:

ddev launch
You will encounter the standard Drupal installation wizard.

Drupal 9 installer from browser

Here you have two options. You can use this UI and follow the wizard through installation, or you can return to your terminal and pass a drush command through ddev. The latter option will automate the installation process and set admin as both your username and password.

Option 1 — Using the Wizard
Return to the wizard in your browser. Under Choose language select a language from the drop-down menu and click Save and continue. Now select an installation profile. You can choose between Standard, Minimal, and Demo. Make your choice and then click Save and continue. Drupal will automatically verify your requirements, set up a database, and install your site. Your last step is to customize a few configurations. Add a site name and a site email address that ends in your domain. Then choose a username and password. Choose a strong password and keep your credentials somewhere safe. Lastly, add a private email address that you regularly check, fill in the regional settings, and press Save and continue.

Your new site will load with a welcome message.
