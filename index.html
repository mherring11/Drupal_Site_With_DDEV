Configure your local development environment to serve your application
Replace my-site with a machine-friendly (no spaces or special punctuation) name for your new application and run the following command (assumes DDEV):

mkdir my-site
cd my-site
ddev config --docroot web --project-name my-site --project-type drupal10 --create-docroot
This will create a new DDEV project configured to host a Drupal application. DDEV will store the generated configuration in a new .ddev subdirectory.

Next, start the DDEV container

ddev start
You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Configuring DDEV first allows us to run Composer from within DDEV instead of installing it locally.

Create a new Drupal application
Next, use Composer to install Drupal, which enables you to install and update dependencies (modules, themes, profiles, libraries, etc.) also with Composer. It is best practice to ensure that your entire Drupal application is managed with Composer in order to facilitate manageable upgrades.

Now create a new Drupal application with Composer. Note: ddev composer create will unpack and download the files into the current folder, unlike composer create-project which downloads Drupal into a separate folder.

ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project
Next install the latest version of Drush, a command-line utility for Drupal.

ddev composer require drush/drush
It is possible to install Drupal with Composer without using the DDEV environment, but not recommended, since PHP versions in DDEV and your local environment may differ.

composer create-project drupal/recommended-project
You now have a web server and database server configured and running.

Install Drupal
Next, you must install Drupal using Drush, which populates your Drupal application’s new database.

Using DDEV and Drush, execute the command below. Replace my-password with the password that you would like to use for the admin (user 1) account.

ddev drush site:install --account-name=admin --account-pass=my-password
Drupal is now installed.

Log In
Finally, launch your new Drupal site and log in.

ddev launch
You can also generate a one-time login link.

ddev drush user:login
If necessary, execute ddev describe to view the URL of your site. Copy and paste that URL into your web browser to visit it.

Log in to the site using the --account-name and --account-pass you specified in the previous section (the section called “Install Drupal”).
